# Lucidium Mapper
sometimes referred to as "lucy"

Lucidium is a mapper designed to mimic the feel of a Game Engine. 
It's designed to be portable, one executable that works anywhere and everywhere. 

## Why should you use this?
I'm not gonna act like this mapper is the best invention since sliced bread. 
It's far from it sctually. Chromapper is by far the best mapping solution available.
In most use cases, Chromapper does what lucidium can and better at that.

## No, seriously. Why should I use this?
You should use this if you 
- A: Want a portable mapping solution
- B: Want a self-contained mapping experience with built in scripting support (no external tools with GDScript!)
- C: Want a mapping expernence styled like a Game Engine.

You SHOULDN'T use this if you
- A: Want a Unity Based Solution (Chromapper)
- B: Want a stable mapping experience (MMA2 and Chromapper Stable)
- C: Want a mostly accurate representation of how your map will play (Chromapper)

## Planned Features
- Mod Support (Noodle, Chroma, Cinema) 
- Built in Scripting without the use of external tools via GDScript
- External Script Editing (JSON, Typescript)
- Environment Editing using Geometry and Billie Environment Enhancements
- FULL AND TOTAL CONTROL over maps within Lucidium
